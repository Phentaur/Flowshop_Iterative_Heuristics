Folders: old code (Archive), pickle file single machine instances for comparison (Data), header functions (Functions), various versions of the heuristic functions (heuristics) neural network models (Models), weights from the models (NN_Weights), pickle files of runtimes and performance data (Output), and training data for the neural network models (Training_Instances).

Main: 1_Single-Machine Flowshop_create_single_machine_pickle creates instances for comparison. 2_Main_Train_NN_CT can either train a new neural network or bring in weights from an existing neural network and print performance. 3_Main_Test_Heur_CT compares the insertion heuristic with the neural network on the same instances compared to in arrival order. 4_Compare_time_vs_NKEEP uses either the insertion or selection algorithm, as selected at the start of the file, over a varying number of kept permutations and either insertion slots from the end or length of permutation window (the parameters changed according to the research paper). 5_Comparison_Graphs creates graphs for both insertion and selection, including pairs plots.
